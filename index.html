<br>
Someday</b><br>
I wait around for death<br>
With a dram of dream wine<br>
Wait for the rain to put food on the vine<br>
I wait for salvation to send me a sign <br>
Wait for the clock to return my time<br>
And, man, I wait for the money that never does come<br>
I wait on the moon and wait on the sun<br>
As I kept waiting for life to begin<br>
I found myself waiting right past the end<br>
You think that someday it’ll all fall in line<br>
It’s bound to get better if you give it time<br>
Wait to be good wait to treat people kind<br>
To fix what needs fixing and make up your mind<br>
Confusion and panic won’t ever let you go<br>
The grass don’t grow greener just watching it grow<br>
If there’s anything left for me to impart<br>
Someday ain’t a good way for your life to start<br>
<br>
<b>Trouble</b><br>
He said if you have to go <br>
Be sure and fly low<br>
The interstate is full of highway patrol<br>
And for all you have consumed and left behind here in this room <br>
You’re bound to find yourself in trouble<br>
I pulled off the highway<br>
Before the night turned into day<br>
To finish what I had in the paper bag<br>
The moon was lying low<br>
And dawn was soon to glow<br>
When those headlights pulled up slow<br>
Trouble more trouble<br>
Like a lonesome whistle in the night<br>
Trouble lord more trouble<br>
Better find someplace to hide<br>
I started up the car<br>
Pulled the gear shift hard<br>
A quarter tank won’t get you far<br>
But I swung the rig around<br>
Speeding down the west bound<br>
There’s not much road till you hit the coast<br>
Flying down highway 1<br>
Without the headlights on <br>
Running from the fear in my rearview mirror<br>
Around the bend I sailed<br>
When the accelerator failed<br>
I saw my hunter fly past the rail<br>
Into the ocean gray he<br>
Sunk beneath the waves<br>
As I watched from the shoulder at the break of day<br>
Singing trouble what trouble<br>
Has pursued me this time<br>
Trouble lord what trouble<br>
Have I got left to deny<br>
<br>
<b>Packin Up</b><br>
You’re packing up, I’m packin in<br>
Lettin go like a fart in the wind <br>
I’m taking the clown car<br>
Full of trouble<br>
Somewhere verdant<br>
Where the last stretch of desert by far<br>
Will be the space between the pool and bar<br>
And I’ll cross that great wide expanse<br>
With a towel around my ass<br>
And a three-string guitar<br>
For you may not well can tell<br>
Whether I’m falling from or falling in<br>
When I come rolling down the road my friend<br>
Puckered like an asterisk again <br>
A little truth ache and big mistakes<br>
You break my heart and ill break your legs<br>
Are you gonna leave me standing in the dark<br>
To feel in the blank<br>
In my double wide nothing new<br>
Night brings on a different shade of blue<br>
I’ve worked up a thirst that just don’t slake<br>
Living in a glass out here in the blank<br>
Cuz I’m a misfire and a leaky tire<br>
Held together with bailing wire<br>
One of these days if I can get it straight<br>
I’m gonna shoot moon and greet the day<br>
No more cheap wine or cigarettes<br>
Paychecks spent on losing bets<br>
I’ll take my hat up off the bed <br>
And hang it somewhere else instead<br>
When god circles me from above<br>
She may be a vulture, she might be a dove<br>
I’m bound to wonder was it enough<br>
That I gave it all my love<br>
<br>
<b>Western Times</b><br>
I’ve had some good old western times<br>
I kicked out the lights, lived high and fine<br>
But when you walk out the door<br>
And out in the rain<br>
You wont hear me complain that my hair don’t stay dry<br>
I been royal and Ive toiled <br>
With my belly down in the soil<br>
Lord I have seen the horizon from the 51st floor<br>
But the hour always comes like shadows on linoleum<br>
Bringing back that old pain <br>
The pain of knowin<br>
Knowin that you’re here then you’re gone<br>
Knowing the last words of my song<br>
Youre not getting any taller<br>
Since you spent that last dollar<br>
Getting high getting low <br>
On that pain that you know<br>
Ive watched my resolve<br>
Alight with the leaves<br>
Like an empty plastic bag<br>
Stuck on the breeze<br>
You said to try again tomorrow<br>
Or this is where it ends<br>
Come on now boys sing me back to the pain of knowing<br>
The light was hanging low and blinking morse code<br>
Let me help you understand you’re dust in the shape of a man<br>
The windd don’t ask where have you been<br>
It just keeps on blowing<br>
And silence rolls in sweet and low<br>
With the pain of knowin<br>
Knowing that you’re here then youre gone<br>
Knowing the last words of my song<br>
Youre not getting any taller since you spent that last dollar<br>
Easy come easy go<br>
Getting high when youre low<br>
On the pain that you know<br>
<br>
<b>Pill Hill</b><br>
I only wanted to make a good impression<br>
And show that I have known joy<br>
But your wig gets crooked and you start talkin dirty<br>
To men that aint nothing but boys<br>
Cowboys and playboys—good old boy decoys<br>
Tonight ill escape from it all<br>
Their happiness long-faded <br>
loneliness is persuasive<br>
With whiskey in an amber-lit hall<br>
And those misunderstandings that get caught between feelings<br>
Well that’s just the bounce of the ball<br>
You want to make an impression but lost sight of your reason<br>
Now your down on your knees in a stall<br>
But then theres not much to say when you live on pill hill<br>
With the sirens and hospital bills<br>
Who knows anything goes with our hooks on the line<br>
Let time undress and unwind<br>
Well you better get home now while your body still knows how<br>
To stay inside those white lines<br>
Fix up your face, walk away from mistakes<br>
And hold back your tear for the drive<br>
<br>
<b>Paradise Plains</b><br>
On these long and hollow Sundays<br>
I got a poured out feeling in my viens<br>
And I go slinking like a panther<br>
Through the backstreets and the alleyways<br>
Looking down my nose for an angle of repose<br>
Or someplace where the light don’t expose my holes<br>
I live on paradise plains<br>
Where there’s static on the air<br>
And a hunger in the stares <br>
Of the young ones living there<br>
Swallow the question on your tongue<br>
Hear the dull hum of despair<br>
Out in paradise plains<br>
Growing thin on thoughts and prayers<br>
If not for my dear mother<br>
Id have left some time ago<br>
But she has to have her medicine<br>
From the Gideon and co.<br>
She don’t say much no more <br>
Just murmurs soft and low<br>
Something about a valley <br>
and the blood that used to flow<br>
<br>
<b>Twilight of My Decency</b><br>
Fear I’ve been told is just every man’s piece<br>
He eats it all alone late at night between the sheets<br>
Its like a terrible thirst and I don’t get me no relief<br>
When the fruit finally bursts it weren’t worth half a squeeze<br>
All life-long I have raked my brain <br>
Across the red-hot coal<br>
On the other side was a salvage yard<br>
Of burned up and totaled souls<br>
You can bury me in some strange old town<br>
In a grave with my name spelled wrong <br>
And I’ll find jesus christ there by my side<br>
With a rope and pair of thongs<br>
I’m rolling snake eyes in paradise <br>
And I must’ve missed my turn<br>
Snake eyes in paradise <br>
Heaven ain’t supposed to burn<br>
Snake eyes in paradise <br>
And I’ve ordered the circumstance<br>
Anake eyes near all my life <br>
And there ain’t no second chance<br>
Some get brought up <br>
With a half empty cup<br>
Born forlorn <br>
And down on their luck<br>
Now the sun is setting <br>
And its quite a sight to see<br>
Whe twilight of my decency <br>
Where lonesome ends with me<br>
I’m rolling snake eyes in paradise <br>
And I must’ve missed my turn<br>
Snake eyes in paradise <br>
Cuz heaven ain’t supposed to burn<br>
It’s a trap door to another shore<br>
On a lake of fire lord<br>
Snake eyes near all my life <br>
And I guess I’ll never learn<br>
<br>
<b>Lee Vine</b><br>
I’m beating hell on the wheel <br>
Of an Oldsmobile<br>
Flying down that 395<br>
Was hard luckin<br>
It was hard leavin<br>
When you’re hearing those old voices again<br>
What a wild and reckless feeling<br>
Somewhere on my mind<br>
I cant find a friend to call this time<br>
I want to blame you again for the straits that I’m in<br>
Who the hell was there behind the trigger<br>
Just a wild and reckless feeling that made it end the way it began<br>
Took off like a flash<br>
On five hundred mile dash<br>
Up to the Nevada state line<br>
Pulling against the wind<br>
And a bottle of gin<br>
I drove into the town of Lee Vine<br>
At the whoa nellie deli<br>
She sat down right beside me<br>
I tried to reset on coffee and smoke<br>
She said sometimes I got a notion for perpetual motion<br>
And I think you might know just what I mean<br>
With a wild and reckless feeling<br>
To chase the blues away<br>
Don’t tell me I’m too old to change my ways<br>
I cant blame you anymore for walking through the door<br>
I needed you more than I was needed<br>
Just a wild and reckless feeling that made it end the way it began<br>
Up at hallelujah junction<br>
The olds malfunctioned<br>
So I took off toward the mountains on my left<br>
And though the sky was spun sugar<br>
I just could not figure<br>
How the ascent had made my heart drop<br>
I said I guess there’s a reason, that dreamers keep dreamin<br>
She said if that’s all you can say there aint no reason to stay<br>
For your wild and reckless feelings<br>
Cant shake you off my mind<br>
I needed someone new to pass the time<br>
I dont blame you entering<br>
The dream I was in<br>
I didn’t even know that I was sleeping<br>
When that wild and reckless feeling made it end the way it began<br>
<br>
<b>Goodbye</b><br>
Is there anything<br>
Really worth the time<br>
Is the truth going to set me free<br>
Cuz that kinda living <br>
Seems lika a prison to me<br>
But its easier told <br>
Than saddled and rode<br>
The truth wont be bought<br>
Chopped up and re-soled<br>
And despite all the warning<br>
I myself must confirm<br>
The fire wont return to whats already burned<br>
Goodbye till I <br>
Do good by you<br>
Goodbye till I do good by you<br>
Like parsley prostrate on the plate<br>
Im resigned to a kind of abstract fate<br>
When trouble comes, man, <br>
It comes creeping through the wall<br>
Spills like a hernia and drapes like a pall<br>
Now im left with quiet <br>
And plenty of time<br>
I suppose that’s why im preoccupied<br>
With black holes and long white halls<br>
Television stories and little shot bottles<br>
Goodbye till I <br>
Do good by you<br>
Goodbye till I do good by you</span></div><pre><br>
