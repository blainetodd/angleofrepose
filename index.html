  <h3>Lyrics</h3>
  <pre>
Someday
I wait around for death
With a dram of dream wine
Wait for the rain to put food on the vine
I wait for salvation to send me a sign 
Wait for the clock to return my time
And, man, I wait for the money that never does come
I wait on the moon and wait on the sun
As I kept waiting for life to begin
I found myself waiting right past the end
You think that someday it’ll all fall in line
It’s bound to get better if you give it time
Wait to be good wait to treat people kind
To fix what needs fixing and make up your mind
Confusion and panic won’t ever let you go
The grass don’t grow greener just watching it grow
If there’s anything left for me to impart
Someday ain’t a good way for your life to start

Trouble
He said if you have to go 
Be sure and fly low
The interstate is full of highway patrol
And for all you have consumed and left behind here in this room 
You’re bound to find yourself in trouble
I pulled off the highway
Before the night turned into day
To finish what I had in the paper bag
The moon was lying low
And dawn was soon to glow
When those headlights pulled up slow
Trouble more trouble
Like a lonesome whistle in the night
Trouble lord more trouble
Better find someplace to hide
I started up the car
Pulled the gear shift hard
A quarter tank won’t get you far
But I swung the rig around
Speeding down the west bound
There’s not much road till you hit the coast
Flying down highway 1
Without the headlights on 
Running from the fear in my rearview mirror
Around the bend I sailed
When the accelerator failed
I saw my hunter fly past the rail
Into the ocean gray he
Sunk beneath the waves
As I watched from the shoulder at the break of day
Singing trouble what trouble
Has pursued me this time
Trouble lord what trouble
Have I got left to deny

Packin Up
You’re packing up, I’m packin in
Lettin go like a fart in the wind 
I’m taking the clown car
Full of trouble
Somewhere verdant
Where the last stretch of desert by far
Will be the space between the pool and bar
And I’ll cross that great wide expanse
With a towel around my ass
And a three-string guitar
For you may not well can tell
Whether I’m falling from or falling in
When I come rolling down the road my friend
Puckered like an asterisk again 
A little truth ache and big mistakes
You break my heart and ill break your legs
Are you gonna leave me standing in the dark
To feel in the blank
In my double wide nothing new
Night brings on a different shade of blue
I’ve worked up a thirst that just don’t slake
Living in a glass out here in the blank
Cuz I’m a misfire and a leaky tire
Held together with bailing wire
One of these days if I can get it straight
I’m gonna shoot moon and greet the day
No more cheap wine or cigarettes
Paychecks spent on losing bets
I’ll take my hat up off the bed 
And hang it somewhere else instead
When god circles me from above
She may be a vulture, she might be a dove
I’m bound to wonder was it enough
That I gave it all my love

Western Times
I’ve had some good old western times
I kicked out the lights, lived high and fine
But when you walk out the door
And out in the rain
You wont hear me complain that my hair don’t stay dry
I been royal and Ive toiled 
With my belly down in the soil
Lord I have seen the horizon from the 51st floor
But the hour always comes like shadows on linoleum
Bringing back that old pain 
The pain of knowin
Knowin that you’re here then you’re gone
Knowing the last words of my song
Youre not getting any taller
Since you spent that last dollar
Getting high getting low 
On that pain that you know
Ive watched my resolve
Alight with the leaves
Like an empty plastic bag
Stuck on the breeze
You said to try again tomorrow
Or this is where it ends
Come on now boys sing me back to the pain of knowing
The light was hanging low and blinking morse code
Let me help you understand you’re dust in the shape of a man
The windd don’t ask where have you been
It just keeps on blowing
And silence rolls in sweet and low
With the pain of knowin
Knowing that you’re here then youre gone
Knowing the last words of my song
Youre not getting any taller since you spent that last dollar
Easy come easy go
Getting high when youre low
On the pain that you know

Pill Hill
I only wanted to make a good impression
And show that I have known joy
But your wig gets crooked and you start talkin dirty
To men that aint nothing but boys
Cowboys and playboys—good old boy decoys
Tonight ill escape from it all
Their happiness long-faded 
loneliness is persuasive
With whiskey in an amber-lit hall
And those misunderstandings that get caught between feelings
Well that’s just the bounce of the ball
You want to make an impression but lost sight of your reason
Now your down on your knees in a stall
But then theres not much to say when you live on pill hill
With the sirens and hospital bills
Who knows anything goes with our hooks on the line
Let time undress and unwind
Well you better get home now while your body still knows how
To stay inside those white lines
Fix up your face, walk away from mistakes
And hold back your tear for the drive

Paradise Plains
On these long and hollow Sundays
I got a poured out feeling in my viens
And I go slinking like a panther
Through the backstreets and the alleyways
Looking down my nose for an angle of repose
Or someplace where the light don’t expose my holes
I live on paradise plains
Where there’s static on the air
And a hunger in the stares 
Of the young ones living there
Swallow the question on your tongue
Hear the dull hum of despair
Out in paradise plains
Growing thin on thoughts and prayers
If not for my dear mother
Id have left some time ago
But she has to have her medicine
From the Gideon and co.
She don’t say much no more 
Just murmurs soft and low
Something about a valley 
and the blood that used to flow

Twilight of My Decency
Fear I’ve been told is just every man’s piece
He eats it all alone late at night between the sheets
Its like a terrible thirst and I don’t get me no relief
When the fruit finally bursts it weren’t worth half a squeeze
All life-long I have raked my brain 
Across the red-hot coal
On the other side was a salvage yard
Of burned up and totaled souls
You can bury me in some strange old town
In a grave with my name spelled wrong 
And I’ll find jesus christ there by my side
With a rope and pair of thongs
I’m rolling snake eyes in paradise 
And I must’ve missed my turn
Snake eyes in paradise 
Heaven ain’t supposed to burn
Snake eyes in paradise 
And I’ve ordered the circumstance
Anake eyes near all my life 
And there ain’t no second chance
Some get brought up 
With a half empty cup
Born forlorn 
And down on their luck
Now the sun is setting 
And its quite a sight to see
Whe twilight of my decency 
Where lonesome ends with me
I’m rolling snake eyes in paradise 
And I must’ve missed my turn
Snake eyes in paradise 
Cuz heaven ain’t supposed to burn
It’s a trap door to another shore
On a lake of fire lord
Snake eyes near all my life 
And I guess I’ll never learn

Lee Vine
I’m beating hell on the wheel 
Of an Oldsmobile
Flying down that 395
Was hard luckin
It was hard leavin
When you’re hearing those old voices again
What a wild and reckless feeling
Somewhere on my mind
I cant find a friend to call this time
I want to blame you again for the straits that I’m in
Who the hell was there behind the trigger
Just a wild and reckless feeling that made it end the way it began
Took off like a flash
On five hundred mile dash
Up to the Nevada state line
Pulling against the wind
And a bottle of gin
I drove into the town of Lee Vine
At the whoa nellie deli
She sat down right beside me
I tried to reset on coffee and smoke
She said sometimes I got a notion for perpetual motion
And I think you might know just what I mean
With a wild and reckless feeling
To chase the blues away
Don’t tell me I’m too old to change my ways
I cant blame you anymore for walking through the door
I needed you more than I was needed
Just a wild and reckless feeling that made it end the way it began
Up at hallelujah junction
The olds malfunctioned
So I took off toward the mountains on my left
And though the sky was spun sugar
I just could not figure
How the ascent had made my heart drop
I said I guess there’s a reason, that dreamers keep dreamin
She said if that’s all you can say there aint no reason to stay
For your wild and reckless feelings
Cant shake you off my mind
I needed someone new to pass the time
I dont blame you entering
The dream I was in
I didn’t even know that I was sleeping
When that wild and reckless feeling made it end the way it began

Goodbye
Is there anything
Really worth the time
Is the truth going to set me free
Cuz that kinda living 
Seems lika a prison to me
But its easier told 
Than saddled and rode
The truth wont be bought
Chopped up and re-soled
And despite all the warning
I myself must confirm
The fire wont return to whats already burned
Goodbye till I 
Do good by you
Goodbye till I do good by you
Like parsley prostrate on the plate
Im resigned to a kind of abstract fate
When trouble comes, man, 
It comes creeping through the wall
Spills like a hernia and drapes like a pall
Now im left with quiet 
And plenty of time
I suppose that’s why im preoccupied
With black holes and long white halls
Television stories and little shot bottles
Goodbye till I 
Do good by you
Goodbye till I do good by you
